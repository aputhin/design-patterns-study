One of our "homework" assignments for the *#engineering-cell* study group at [ilegra](http://ilegra.com/).

These are personal notes and example code for the [GOF Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). Actually, the main source I've used was [this one](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns), and *maybe* I'll create a md with some other resources. :P
