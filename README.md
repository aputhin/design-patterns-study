These are personal notes and example code for the [GOF Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns). Motivated by our **#engineering-cell** study group at [ilegra](http://ilegra.com/) (Think Beyond!).

We are commited to coding examples in Java, but I'm not a Java programmer, so expect the worse from the example code. Sometime in the future I plan to compile it and run, and also provide some JS specific code and analysis, but that's a big @TODO.
